    made gfx update every 625000 instructions -> 1964 demo fully works
    (isn't the right way to do it, but it works)

    Made a sexy package type thinger

Oct 19 2001 by HCl:

    Changed romloader quite a bit: modules are loaded interactively.

Oct 03 2001 by Bluefyre:

    Realised the named stuff is worse than useless unless the debugger dumps
    stuff with those names too, so i made it do that.

    Fixed a bug in my symlink makefile thing

    Hacked with the romloader so you can run it from cpucore_pure_c/ now
    without it complaining it can't find the libs

    Miscellaneousness, I made it make the symlink to loader automatically

    The debugger now shows you the register names not numbers

    (Note that we haven't been able to do a lot because the cvs server has 
     been down)

    Additions:

    cpucore_pure_c:
        
    a crude debugger :))) (libcpu.c, maybe move to it's own sourcefile)

    commands: run next breakpoint show dumpregs help quit

    Additions:

    Lots of store/load instructions, and a few others
    massive speed optimizations in store/load instructions -> code much faster
    optimized CFLAGS

Jul 21/22 2001 by HCl:

    Additions/Optimizations:
 
    cpucore_pure_c:

    added more ram areas
    added lots of other instructions
    added dCPU_COP1 support
    added dCPU_COP1_CFC1
    added dCPU_COP1_CTC1 
    added eCPU_COP1_CFC1
    added eCPU_COP1_CTC1
    added eCPU_LW
    added fpr registers of cop1 to registers.h
    optimized eCPU_SW
    added CPUdelay slot (omg i can't believe we forgot this)
	-> code makes much more sense

    Changes:

    cpucore_pure_c:

    fixed comments in registers.h
    fixed ADDIU in exec.c: sgi people use misleading names for opcodes!

Jul 21 2001 by Bluefyre:

    Additions:

    cpucore_pure_c:

    added eCPU_COP0 support
    added MFC0/MTC0 (cop0) (cop0_scp.c)
    added COP0 (exec.c)
    changed some .h's to match opcodes.h
    changed opstruct.c to match

    Changes:

    cpucore_pure_c:

    made do_a_dump() dump fgrs (libcpu.c)
    made do_a_dump() print to stderr (libcpu.c)
    messed with do_a_dump() to make it look nicer (libcpu.c)

    made a debug_do_a_dump() for HCl (libcpu.c)
    made EXCESSIVE_DEBUG use debug_do_a_dump() (libcpu.c)

    changed the Changelog :O)

Jul 18/19 2001 by HCl: 

    Additions/Optimizations:

    cpucore_pure_c:
 
    added MFC0/MTC0 (cop0) (disass.c)
    added JAL/JR (exec.c)
    optimized SLTU (exec.c)
    optimized BEQ (exec.c)
    optimized BNE (exec.c
    added ADDI (exec.c)
    added RDRAM memory support (experimental) (libcpu.c,exec.c)
    put ifdef checks around info functions in main_cpu_loop (libcpu.c)
    added mentioning the PC when disassembling an instruction (libcpu.c)
    Error handling optimized (libcpu.c)
		  
    Fixes:
  
    romloader:
  
    load_module.h missing  -> fixed
    bad,sloppy asm code in fix_rom_name -> fixed: replaced with C code 	

    cpucore_pure_c:

    counting of instructions disassembled -> fixed
    instruction pointer didn't use native addys -> jumps broken -> fixed
    instruction pointer advanced after jump -> jumps broken -> fixed
    eCPU_BEQ, eCPU_BNE didn't add 4 to the jump addy -> fixed
    dCPU_JAL* : didn't shift target left by 2 -> fixed
